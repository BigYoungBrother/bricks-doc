# Timer
## 01 用法

Timer是Java原生的定时器类，通过该类可实现指定时间间隔的定时任务

### 0x01 使用实例

定义一个基于Timer的定时任务非常简单，如下：

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Timer;
import java.util.TimerTask;

public class TimerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. 实例化Timer对象
        Timer timer = new Timer();

        // 2. 定义一个任务
        TimerTask timerTask = new TimerTask() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                // todo 具体的任务执行逻辑
                System.out.println("定时任务正在执行...");
            }
        };

        // 3. 将timerTask交给Timer进行调度
        timer.schedule(timerTask, new Date(), 10 * 1000L);
    }
}
```

### 0x02 Timer的构造方法详解

```java
Timer() // 无参构造方法，会调用Timer(String name)方法实例化Timer对象，其中name是自动生成的，格式为Timer-[序列号]，使用非后台线程调度任务
Timer(boolean isDaemon) //isDaemon表示是否以后台线程的方式调度任务
Timer(String name) //name是Timer里面任务执行线程（TimerThread）的名字，默认非后台
Timer(String name, boolean isDaemon) //指定Timer的名字和运行方式(后台和非后台)
```

### 0x03 schedule方法的参数详解

```java
schedule(TimerTask task, long delay) // delay时间后执行一次任务, delay的单位为ms
schedule(TimerTask task, Date time) // 在time时间执行一次任务
schedule(TimerTask task, long delay, long period) // 在delay时间后以固定的时间间隔period执行任务， 这里的时间间隔是上一次任务开始执行到下次开始执行的时间间隔, delay的单位为ms

scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, long delay, long period) // 在delay时间后以固定的时间间隔period执行任务， 这里的时间间隔不同于上面的时间间隔，下面进行详解, delay的单位为ms
scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, Date firstTime, long period) // 在time时间后以固定的时间间隔period执行任务， 这里的时间间隔不同于上面的时间间隔，下面进行详解
```

schedule方法的时间间隔和scheduleAtFixedRate的时间间隔不同
假如定义一个任务每10s执行一次
schedule任务控制的是在任务执行开始到任务执行结束的时间间隔
如果任务在18:30:10执行一次，第二次和第三次时间执行为 18:30:20和18:30:30
但是任务到达18:30:20的时间时，由于线程没有调度导致任务到18:30:25才调度起来，那么计算第三次任务执行的时间是18:30:35

scheduleAtFixedRate方法的时间间隔是固定的，不计算任务由于没有调度导致的延时
如果任务在18:30:10执行一次，第二次和第三次时间执行为 18:30:20和18:30:30
即使任务到达18:30:20的时间时，由于线程没有调度导致任务到18:30:25才调度起来，则计算第三次调度任务执行的时间仍然是18:30:30

## 源码详解

### 0x01 原理

Timer机制定时任务的原理如下图所示，共涉及4个类：

- TimerTask 实现了Runable接口，在run方法中定义具体的任务逻辑
- Timer 定时任务的调度类，持有TimerThread对象和TaskQueue对象，在schedule方法中启动TimerThread线程
- TimerThread 继承Thread线程，在run方法中循环从TaskQueue中取出下一个待执行的任务，然后调用TimerTask的run方法执行任务
- TaskQueue 底层是一个TimerTask数组，按照小顶堆的结构存储任务，其中小顶堆的排序依据是任务的一次执行时间（单位ms）

![](./images/timer/timer.png)

这里需要说明一下：TimerTask虽然是实现了Runable接口，但是任务执行时并不是以新的线程执行的，在任务执行时还是直接调用的run方法，这里实现Runable接口只是为了统一任务的行为

### 0x02 TimerTask

### 0x03 Timer

```java
package java.util;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

/**
 * A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
 * background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
 * repeated execution at regular intervals.
 *
 * 以线程的形式调度任务，任务可能需要调度一次，也可能以一定的时间间隔调度
 *
 * <p>Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background
 * thread that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially.
 * Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
 * to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread.  This can, in
 * turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and
 * execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
 * completes.
 * 以一个线程的形式调度所有的任务，所以任务应该是很快就能执行完的，如果任务执行比较耗时，那么其后面的待执行任务就会阻塞
 * 后面任务会在当前任务执行完成后立即被调度
 *
 * <p>After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away
 * <i>and</i> all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task
 * execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
 * collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
 * default, the task execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>,
 * so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
 * wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller
 * should invoke the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method.
 * 如果任务都已经执行完了（任务无需再执行）那么应该使用cancel方法停止timer
 * 原因：任务执行完成之后，timer会交给垃圾回收器进行回收，但是回收的时间不能确定，而且默认情况下任务是非后台的线程在执行，所以任务会阻止程序的关闭
 *
 * <p>If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
 * example, because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further
 * attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if the timer's <tt>cancel</tt>
 * method had been invoked.
 * 任务的不正常停止（stop方法或者被调度已被其他的timer调度的任务），会导致IllegalStateException异常，并调用cancel方法取消任务
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
 * <tt>Timer</tt> object without the need for external synchronization.
 *
 * Timer是线程安全的，对象可以被多个线程共享使用
 *
 * <p>This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
 * tasks using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.
 * 不保证实时调度，因为使用的是Object.wait()方法来等待执行时间到来
 *
 *
 * 更优雅的任务调度类 ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * <p>Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and
 * one of the concurrency utilities therein is the {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly
 * executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
 * versatile replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask}
 * combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
 * time units, and doesn't require subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just
 * implement {@code Runnable}).  Configuring {@code
 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to
 * {@code Timer}.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
 * scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
 * it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
 * a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.
